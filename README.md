# Python Calculator Project

A simple command-line calculator built in Python. This project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations in an interactive way, reusing results for consecutive calculations.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface.
- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- Stores operations in a dictionary for dynamic function calling.
- Allows continuous calculations with previous results.
- Restart functionality for new calculations.
- Includes ASCII art/logo for visual enhancement.

## Concepts Covered

- **Functions** – defining reusable functions for arithmetic operations.
- **Dictionaries** – mapping operators to their corresponding functions.
- **Loops** – using `while` loops to continue calculations until the user exits.
- **Control Flow** – `if/else` statements to handle continuation logic.
- **User Input** – reading and handling input from the command line.
- **Function References** – storing and calling functions dynamically via a dictionary.
- **Modules** – importing external modules (like ASCII art/logo) to enhance the project.

## How to Run

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/calculator-project.git

cd calculator-project

python calculator.py

## Example

What is the first value?: 
10
Pick an operation: +, -, *, /: 
+
What is your second value?: 
5
10 + 5 = 15
Type 'yes' to continue with the current result, or 'no' to start fresh:
yes
